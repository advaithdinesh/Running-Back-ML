# Running-Back-ML
This project takes every starting running back during the 2021-22 NFL season and projects their statistics (attempts and yards) for a selected game during their career. The test data inclueds every single game from that player's career, and the output is compared to the actual values from the game that is being predicted in order to compare the accuracy of the prediction.
